				opportunity and present yourself and your brand in the best possible
				way. This is where people come to learn more about your brand and
				the people behind it. There’s also a high chance that your About Us
				page will be your most frequently viewed page. You need to make sure
				that the information you add on the About Us page accurately
				represents who you are as a brand. That’s why we’ve included a list
				that you can go through to make sure you haven’t missed anything
				crucial.</p>
